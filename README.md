ST2195 - Practice Assignment 6 (EUR/USD Exchange Rate Return)

In this project, we analysed transcripts from ecb speeches that resulted in a positive or negative usd/eur exchange rate fluctuations.
An analysis of the most common words found that most words were common. 
"crises" was uniquely in the top 20 words on good days, and "term" was uniquely in the top 20 words on bad days.
Further filtering found "integration" and "money" on good days and "level", "interest", "international" on bad days.

Overall the use of individual words is probably too simplistic to return noteworthy results.
However, a more detailed model could prove more useful. 
For example, in recent meetings, investors were on the look out for words like "stagflation", "FAIT", "Paul Volcker", "quantitative easing" or "quantitative tightening", etc. as topics that could panic or spur on investors.
